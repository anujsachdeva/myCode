/*** How to run the program ***
*******************************

1. Type "make test" from the a3 directory to make the test file.

2. The Makefile will send an executable called listTest to the bin folder.

3. Navigate to bin folder and type ./listTest in order to run a test of the linkedList.c functions.

4. Type "make sim" from the a3 directory to make the simulation. 

5. Navigate to the bin folder and type ./runsim file1.txt file2.txt

/*** About the test program ***
**************************

All of the linked list functions are tested with output for what is currently being tested. 


/*** About the simulation ***
**************************

The program will read in from two files and build correct linked lists for both ticketlines.
The program will fill the linked list snack line, by alternating between the two files. 
The program finds the length of the snack line by summing the patrons purchase times.
The program does not output the results to report.txt
 

/*** Known errors ***
*********************

The simulation is not complete.
